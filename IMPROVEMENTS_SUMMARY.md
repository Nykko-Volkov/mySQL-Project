# Restaurant Management System - Improvements Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed and Improved

### 1. **Fixed Migration Issues**
- Resolved the foreign key mismatch error that was preventing database migrations
- All migrations now work properly
- Database is in a clean, working state

### 2. **Added Support for Non-Member (Walk-in) Customers**
Your restaurant system now supports TWO types of customers:

**Registered Customers:**
- Customers who have accounts in your database
- Select from dropdown list when creating orders

**Walk-in Customers:**
- Customers who just walk in without having an account
- Simply enter their name and phone number
- No need to create a full customer profile first

### 3. **Simplified All Models with Clear Comments**

**Order Model (`orders/models.py`):**
```python
# Now supports both registered and walk-in customers
customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer, ...)  # For registered customers
customer_name = models.CharField(...)        # For walk-in customer name
customer_phone = models.CharField(...)       # For walk-in customer phone

# Helper methods to get customer info regardless of type
def get_customer_name(self):  # Gets name from either source
def get_customer_phone(self):  # Gets phone from either source
```

**Customer Model (`customers/models.py`):**
- Clear comments for each field explaining what it does
- Simplified structure with line-by-line explanations

**Product Model (`menu/models.py`):**
- Every field clearly commented
- Explains pricing, categories, tax calculations

**Staff Model (`staff/models.py`):**
- Job roles clearly defined
- Employment tracking simplified

**User Model (`accounts/models.py`):**
- Permission levels clearly explained
- Role-based access simplified

### 4. **Improved Order Creation Form**
- Modern Bootstrap design
- Radio buttons to choose customer type (Registered or Walk-in)
- Fields show/hide automatically based on selection
- Better user experience with clear instructions

### 5. **Enhanced Views with Better Logic**
- Handles both customer types automatically
- Better error handling and success messages
- Clear comments explaining each step
